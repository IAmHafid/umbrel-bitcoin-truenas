# ‚òÇÔ∏è bitcoin

The official bitcoin application for [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os). It wraps [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)'s RPC exposes it via a RESTful API.

A variety of applications that run on Umbrel use bitcoin to interact with the bitcoin network.

## üöÄ Getting started

This application can be installed with one click via Umbrel's app store.

Make sure a [`bitcoind`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) instance is running and available on the same machine.
## üõ† Running bitcoin

### Step 1. Install dependencies
```sh
yarn
```

### Step 2. Set environment variables
Set the following environment variables directly or by placing them in `.env` file of project's root.

| Variable | Description | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `PORT` | Port where middleware should listen for requests | `3005` |
| `DEVICE_HOSTS` | Comma separated list of IPs or domain names to whitelist for CORS | `http://umbrel.local` |
| `BITCOIN_HOST` | IP or domain where `bitcoind` RPC is listening | `127.0.0.1` |
| `RPC_USER` | `bitcoind` RPC username  |  |
| `RPC_PASSWORD` | `bitcoind` RPC password |  |

### Step 3. build the web interface
```sh
yarn install:ui
yarn build:ui
```

### Step 4. Run bitcoin
```sh
yarn start
```

You can access the web interface by visiting `http://localhost:8080/`

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Don't be too reckless

> Umbrel is still in an early stage and things are expected to break every now and then. We **DO NOT** recommend running it on the mainnet with real money just yet, unless you want to be really *#reckless*.
